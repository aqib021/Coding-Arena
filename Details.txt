Welcome to Coding Arena.
Coding Arena is basically a project created with python.
The most common practice or target for any coding language is printing as output.
The most popular coding languages are C, Java, Python, etc. 
Every language is different from one another also. 
In this project, my target is to establish a python code,
where users can insert input as a string and get their desired code as output not only the traditional output.
Thus a lot of time can be saved and easy to get printing code for multiple programming languages.
